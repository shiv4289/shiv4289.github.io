<p>You can still apply for an internship program at IIT Bombay this summer. I have an experience of it and I can assure you that its a really good environment. You will get to learn a lot. Plus, Bombay is such an excellent place to visit :) I received an e-mail from them today. Here is what it contained:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Students,</p>

<p>If you are in BE/B-tech third year and want to get into an internship program, I think you should go for it.It will also be open for second year students but third year people are generally preferred. Leave a comment if you have any clarifications !!!</p>
