<p>It was the summer of 2007. I was a a class X student whose only interaction with a computer had been having played Mario once kind of 5 years ago. I was offered to choose between one of biology and computer science. Mathematics or Hindi Language being the other choice I had to make. Though I used to write poems, stories, give lecture in Hindi (believe me, I was quite famous in school for these), Mathematics was my darling (Alas, this changed at college!) and it was easy to chose Mathematics. The choice between Biology and Computer science was a difficult one and it ended up in the favor of computer science just because I was terrible at drawing a heart or a kidney. Some of my friends would remember that I took 3 hours to draw a heart in my biology class ;)</p>
<p>So I ended up being a computer science geek and thankfully so, for I am thoroughly enjoying the experience every single day. The next two years the only interaction I had with a computer was the blue<a title="turboC" href="http://turbo-c.soft32.com/"> turboC</a> screen, yes the horrible old compiler but I have very fond memories of it, so I still don't call it stupid :) The <a title="object oriented programing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">OOPs</a> concepts two years later was better than it is today, thanks to Nancy Madam. Ma'm, if you are reading this, you deserve a big thanks. And the choice of branch when I got into engineering was a no brainer.</p>
<p>Thanks to all those, whose names appear in the <a title="People who helped me become what I am today, well whatever I am " href="http://shiv4289.wordpress.com/acknowledgements/">acknowledgement section of this blog</a> and more, I am a proud open source contributor working for the most popular database on web- MySQL. I am a part of MySQL replication development team and working with these guys here is a looooooot of fun. Being a part of MySQL Replication for an year, I feel the best part has been the amount of learning that has come talking to the MySQLers, not to forget the NCGs 2012 (Well, we are a bunch of people, new college grads who joined MySQL in July 2012). NCGs you rock \o/.</p>
<p>Lets now return to the title and motivation for this post. It was a dream since 2007 when I had no interaction with computers- to develop a lot of features, to contribute to the this golden age of technology as much as I can. And the first tiny (well, tiny in terms of years of contributing to software development which I aim at) step into this world, my first design and implementation for a MySQL replication feature is now released. And while people check out the blogs on this feature, browse the source I have written, I will sit and enjoy motivating myself to do a lot more into this huge IT world. I am a software developer by choice, nothing very very big as of now, but I am confident I will make it really really big one day. For now, for the first time in my life, I feel I have become a software developer and its time to start on the journey.</p>
