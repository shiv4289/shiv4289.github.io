I am one of those lucky ones who got to work at MySQL as well and I&nbsp;thoroughly&nbsp;enjoy the experience every single day. I believe this is the golden age of technology and I aim to &nbsp;contribute my bit to it affecting millions of people through an open source software – the most popular open source database on web – MySQL !&nbsp;At MySQL I am currently working as a software developer with the replication team,&nbsp;which provides high-availability solution built into MySQL server.&nbsp;My area of&nbsp;expertise revolves around analyzing and enhancing performance Database replicas, enhancing the replication monitoring tools.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: #fefefe; color: #333333; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">This blog is an attempt to reach out to people and share the tiny details I know about MySQL Replication.&nbsp;</span><b style="background-color: #fefefe; color: #333333; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"><i>The views expressed on this blog are my own and do NOT necessarily reflect the views of Oracle Corporation.</i>&nbsp;</b><br /><span style="background-color: #fefefe; color: #333333; line-height: 1.5em;"><br /></span><br /><div><span style="background-color: #fefefe; color: #333333; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">I do not claim that all information available on this blog is perfectly correct.
