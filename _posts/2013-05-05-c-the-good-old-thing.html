<p>Today, I remember a comment from a friend of mine when I started into the world of programming taking up a course in C++. He said "Dude, C++ is an old thing. Who uses it today? Arent there fancier suff out there? And why would someone take a C++ route?"  That was my first day at programming. I didnt know much about these languages to have a good answer to that. But, 8 years later I have an answer to it. Yes, Thats a pretty long time. But I know what I like now and that is what the title of the post says. Yes<em><strong>, To me, it comes as a trade off between the needs to prioritize development speed over execution speed, which is where all these “fancy” languages tend to shine.</strong> </em>In my experience, these other languages execute fast enough on smaller projects, but start to break down on larger ones. If you still dont agree look at the list of software written in C. Thats a big fat list with some of the most used software out there. <a title="123" href="http://jabroo.blogspot.in/2012/08/c-plus-plus-applications-list.html">Here </a>is a list on the same. Pheww thats loooong. Isnt it? Well, I cant guarantee the authenticity of each and every item on that list but I see names of which I know that they are written in C++. So, I do trust it.</p>
<p>As much as C++’s large feature set and "strict" syntax may be seen as a complex thing for newbies to master, it is about giving the power to express everything one wants directly, unlike any other “simpler” language. I cant stop myself from throwing out something I  read on wiki recently.</p>
<blockquote><p> A widely distributed "satirical" article portrayed Bjarne Stroustrup confessing that C++ was deliberately designed to be complex and difficult, weeding out amateur programmers and raising the salaries of the few programmers who could master the language :D.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, thats the challenge. You have all the design tools and if you have the expertise you will definitely love C++. As a matter of fact, I love C for that matter because it gives all the more development speed but then I think its incomplete without all the features and libraries C++ offers on top of it. C++ with its object oriented capability and STL looks a lot more powerful. And with the latest addition being C++11 it adds to the power. Here is a list of things I see in C++11 which excites all the more. Though I am not sure about the stability of all these set of features, it definitely pleases me on the first look. Its time to get your hand dirty trying out all these. Lets have a look at the list:</p>
<p>1) Important Syntax cleanup<br />
2) Automatic type deduction with Auto<br />
3) Range Based for loops<br />
4) Lambda Functions<br />
5) standardized support for multithreaded programming.<br />
6) regex support<br />
7) Chrono library to deal with time duration and points<br />
8) Containers such as unordered_map, unordered_set and Tuples etc<br />
9) Headers for random number generation and ration class templates.</p>
<p>I will try and cover a post on each of these in future. But for now, lets play around with these<br />
new tools. And once the tools are sharpened lets discus them.</p>
<p>Cheers !!!</p>
