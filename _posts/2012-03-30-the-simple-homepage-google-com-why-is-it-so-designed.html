<p>White, to me,  is the favourite colour for it  projects purity, cleanliness, and neutrality. Doctors don white coats, brides traditionally wear white gowns, and a white picket fence surrounds a safe and happy home. White is clean, neat and classy and looks pleasing to the eye. But is it the reason why the google homepage is also white in background. What does it project about Google ? What message does it convey ?</p>
<p>Ever Wondered why the google homepage is such a simple one ? No flashy looks, nothing moving here and there, no ads, absolutely nothing more than the simple plain search! You would probably guess that its a well thought move , definitely a deliberate decision. Of course, we dont expect the big G to be casual about it for its an unmatched web giant. Is it because they didnt have people to design it more elegantly/appealing ? Sounds kind of funny ! Right ? Well, it isnt !</p>
<p>If Google's vice president of local, maps and location services, Mayer is to be believed, <a title="a" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/27/google-design-sergey-brin_n_1384074.html">this is a result of the limited knowledge of the co-founders of Google</a>. This is what Sergey Brin had to say to Mayor when enquired about it. <em><strong>His own knowledge of HTML was not that great and they did not have webmasters</strong></em>, plus they wanted to test their search technique quickly which they were pretty confident about.</p>
<p><a title="b" href="http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/the_truth_about.html">Some argue that it could have been more user friendly and needed less clicks had they put more options , more graphics on their homepage</a>. To some extent I do agree with them, but then i personally feel its an iconic page with a neat look. Almost all other pages on web are a little more cluttered and most importantly we are used to this plain simple look which by now looks so pleasing to the eye. To me its a classy choice to keep it this way. What do you think though ??</p>
