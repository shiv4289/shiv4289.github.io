I am a computer science professional and I made my own website because I wanted to accumulate all my accounts on web to one place. Having been done that I feel I should have probably done that much earlier. In fact one should be very serious about setting up their own website, I mean everyone.. yes everyone should! You may be tempted to ask why, well because it is your identity. You may now ask- Isn’t my facebook/linkedIn/twitter profile the same? Yes they can be if you don’t have a website that defines you. You don’t control what they show. They care more about what gives them most traffic than your online image or for that matter think of what your friends can do to make these profiles worse at times. Nothing bad about it, everyone has fun and one is supposed to take that lightly. Thats fair but do you realy want to allow them to define your identity? Do you really want those contents to show up when someone searches your name on google? Still not convinced? Have a look at some of the following advantages:

<h3>Why make my own website?</h3>

1. You have all information about you accessible from **one space**.
2. You decide what you want to show the world when they type your name on a search engine.
3. You own your website so you control what image people carry of you.
4. In the long-term its **your brand** on the web.
5. You learn some more technology available there- don’t be scared though, its pretty easy.
6. **Flexibility**- you decide how you present stuff to the world, what is right content and what’s not.
7. You could start to earn **financial benefits** as well, but we will not discuss how to do that.
8. You have more than your resume and linkedIn profile to share when you want to change jobs.
9. You show you **know the technology** and give a sense of **professionalism**.

<h3>Why such a hurry?</h3>

Because there are more people than the most intuitive domain names. In my case, I wanted to have my website on my name itself. Type your name on say facebook to convince yourself that there are more people of the same name as of you. So the domain names are being taken up quite fast and you should book your own domain as soon as possible. Go check if your favourite domain is available or already taken up- [Search your favourite domain on godaddy](http://www.godaddy.com). Even if you don’t want to have a website of your own at the moment, you SHOULD book your domain to be able to use it in future.

<h3>Do I need the hosting space as well?- NO! </h3>

Once you have chosen your domain and reserved it for yourself its time to set up the contents. You may also buy the hosting space- the space where you keep the contents (HTML source/images etc), the domain registrars will infact persuade you to buy the hosting space as well. If you don’t really need more than a simple blog you dont need to buy the space to host your website. You can host your the contents of your website on [github](https://github.com/). For instance [here](https://github.com/shiv4289/shiv4289.github.io) is my code for this website. If you need more you can also use the 2 GB data dropbox allows you for free as well.

<h3> What do I need? </h3>

Assuming you have your domain booked, you now need:

1. A [github account](https://github.com/join), register on github if you don’t have an account already.
2. A theme for you blog- I used [Jekyll bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) for this. [Get started with Jekyll bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/lessons/jekyll-introduction.html), its easy.
3. A third party tool to handle your comments section. I use [disqus](https://disqus.com/).

<h3>What about the blogs I already have?</h3>

If you have a blog already then you need to import those to your website. I had two blogs- one at wordpress and one at blogger and I could import all those contents to this website losing absolutely nothing. The good news is its easy to import those to this space. There are a lot of people who have been doing that and hence these is a lot of support for the same available on web. Note that these tools don’t import the comments you had on your old blog. For this, you will have to add your website to disqus, import the comments on your old blog to disqus and then link these comments from disqus to your blog.

<h3>Concluding Remarks</h3>

I hope this gives you an overview and also gets you the extra push you required before you take a final decision to map all your online presence to your website. If you need any help on figuring out things do drop a comment. The [github support](https://github.com/contact) and [disqus support](http://disqus.com/support/) is also there to help you out in case you need.
