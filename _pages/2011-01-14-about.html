<p>I am called "shiv" , a graduate from BIT Mesra , Ranchi pursuing BE(IT) . I love knowing the technology, there is no end to it, and I keep mining web to know more. I am in complete awe with the technology today and the incredible speed at which it is evolving, thanks to the tech giants (apple,microsoft,goole,facebook,twitter,amazon,oracle etc). I am an software Developer , l love coding  and this is what most of the posts here will be concerned with - technology/coding/algorithms. I love to share some exciting stuff I learn while I browse internet . Sometimes, I would also post some questions/solutions/ some snippets of code from some random  sites. In addition to these , I post some random ideas/views on certain things.  I am new to this world of blogging and I would love to have your views. Please feel free to leave a comment or two if u have any query/suggestions/correction on any page / post of mine .</p>
