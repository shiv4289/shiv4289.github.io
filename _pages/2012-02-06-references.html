<p>Here is a list of few <strong>books</strong> i usually refer while i code :</p>
<p>1) Introduction to Algorithms - by CLRS . <a title="b" href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005/index.htm">Notes and lectures</a> are also available at the MIT website .</p>
<p>2) Art of Programming Contest (for <a title="UVA" href="http://uva.onlinejudge.org/">UVA</a>) by Ahmed Shamsul Arefin : The appendix B of this book contains some really useful readymade  codes . Also this is an excellent book to have if you are a uva programmer . Also this contains topic-wise selection of some really good problems to practice at the <a title="uva site" href="http://uva.onlinejudge.org/">uva site</a> .</p>
<p>3) Programming Challenges by Steven Skiena . I have watched the video lectures taken by skiena himself and he is really good at it . The lectures are available on web .</p>
<p>4) The C Programming Language by Kernighan and Ritchie . The solution of the exercises for this book is also available . I have got a copy of "The C answer Book " by Clovis L.Tondo and Scott E Gimpel .</p>
<p>5) Data structure by Tennenbaum (and two more authors i guess..) .</p>

<p>In addition to these I have watched a series  of video lectures available on internet . Some of them recorded at MIT , Standford and IIT KGP proved quite useful for me !!!!   I love watching video lectures and they have proved quite handy too . But its a personal choice . If you need video lectures on some topics related to computer science or some reference on any other computer science topic , I would be really happy to help if I can .</p>
