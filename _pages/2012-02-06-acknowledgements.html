<p>Here are a few people , I think , who really helped me improve my coding skills.</p>
<ol>
<li><a title="Anshuman Ansu" href="http://aansu.wordpress.com/">Anshuman Ansu  </a>  helped me get started with uvaonlinejudge . I had tried the same twice earlier but with a little success. With his help , I first  started  using dev-C++ instead of the turboC compiler (which was a really boring  one and that is why it finds a mention here !!)    next, i submitted my first solution to a uva question , which I think was a really big leap into the programming world for me . I owe a lot to uva and therefore anshu as well . He also helped me get an internship at IIT Bombay where for the first time I could understand how software development is a lot different compared to online coding :)</li>
<li><a title="Sujeet Kumar" href="https://sites.google.com/a/bitmesra.ac.in/robern/">Sujeet Kumar</a>  : I think it will take a very long time (a no of pages :P) for me to write how much he helped me grow as a programmer. It was with his guidance , I got introduced to some excellent references for coding/algo etc.. . Not to forget the video lectures ( I love them.)</li>
<li>Gagandeep Singh  helped me understand each and every line of ritchie's book - The C Programming Language , which I personally think every programmer must have read , and Test UR C skills by Yashwant Kanitkar .</li>
<li>Neha Singh has edited so many codes of mine . Its really a tough job (n irritating for me :P) .</li>
<li>Mayank Kumar , Manish Kumar , Abhishek Anand , Shashidhar sundareshian ,Gourab Mitra ,Aayush Kumar etc .. who are all my friends at college and we discuss some codes among ourselves .</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Trust me there are a lot more ...... But this is all I can remember right now ......</li>
</ul>
