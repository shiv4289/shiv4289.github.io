**Hey this is Shiv! ** More formally I am Shivji Kumar Jha, a twenty something boy based out of Bangalore, India. I love knowing more of the technology today and I keep mining web to know more of it. I am in complete awe with the web as it stands today and the incredible speed at which it is evolving. I intend to contribute to it as much I can.

In 2012 I graduated in IT from [BIT Mesra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birla_Institute_of_Technology,_Mesra). I fell in love with [MySQL](http://dev.mysql.com/) sometime ago and I consider myself lucky to land up with a job in the MySQL developement team. I thoroughly enjoy the experience here every single day. I am extremely passionate about software development and currently I work as a developer on the MySQL replication module. You can read more about my work on [my MySQL blog](http://work.shivjijha.com/)

Apart from programming, I am mad about cricket which was my first love. Not being able to take up cricket as a profession I took up computers and I am in love with software & web now. I love to share whatever exciting I learn and I intend to either be able to discuss them with my readers or know them better discussing it with them. If that helps some people along the way that just means they are lucky. You can see my coding blog [here](http://shiv4289.wordpress.com). Do let me know what you think of my ramblings.

In future I also wish to write about cricket and politics. Lets see if we can get started with these soon as well. Cheers!
